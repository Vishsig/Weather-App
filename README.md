<h1>Weather App</h1>
<h3>Tech Stack - JavaScript, HTML & CSS</h3>
<p>A web application to display weather info of a city</p>
<p>In this project I used async await and fused OpenWeather API to power this webpage. It shows stats like current temperature, city, humidity, wind speed and dynamic weather icon.</p>
